	<p><B><I><center>MY name is OGEN TOMAS 2021/bit/116/ps
		It was my first time using html and I thought of it as difficult while writing the code tough as it was at first with some time.<br> I tried to cope as there were others that had some ideas and i tried to consult,  watched a few tutorials and online classe on w3 schools .<br>I am hoping it will be goood and interesting with time in my programming career as a young developer studying at MUST.
